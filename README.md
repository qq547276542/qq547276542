### Hi there 👋

- 🏫 I'm a master of ECNU software engineering (2017-2020), during which I mainly studied NLP and KG (Knowledge Graph).
- 🌱 After graduation, I joined the Bytedance SAMI (Speech, Audio & Music Intelligence) team and began to engage in research on TTS (text-to-speech), VC (voice conversion), etc.
